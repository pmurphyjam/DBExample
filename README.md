Uses AppIOS submodule which has SQLite infrastructure for accessing an SQLite database.
Note : If your coping this you will have to pull this library and copy it into the ABExample\AppIOS folder.

This DBExample edits an existing Company table, you can insert, delete, or update a Company, and also 
get all the existing company's via a simple select statement.

This App has built in Crash Logs using the NSException+Category which is used in main.m. When a crash 
occurs the fully symbolicated stack trace will be written into the CrashData table. When the App then
resumes again after the crash, this table is checked for new entries in the AppDelete : uploadCrashData.
This method would then send the crash data to the Server.

This App also supports incremental upgrades to the database via the AppInfo Table and it's version
identifier. The upgradeDB:(double)dbVersion method will check for the current version, and perform
SQL alter table commands to upgrade the existing DB to the latest version.

In addition this App incorporates Google Analytics, you will need to set your own AnalyticsIdentifier in
the DBExample-Info.plist.

Note : In the DBExample Xcode project : Build Phases, there is a Run Script that has two lines commented
out. These lines add a GitCommit and BuildDate to the App and are stored within the App. An initial build
will have issues with this script, but once it's built once it should work fine there after so you can then
comment these lines in the Run Script back in. Now your App will be able to display it's GitCommit, and
BuildDate in the App, and this information is also incorporated into the Crash Logs which can be uploaded
to a Server.
